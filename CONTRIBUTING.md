```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** from `main` for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   pnpm lint
   pnpm type-check
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** following the commit message guidelines

5. **Push to your fork**:

## Coding Standards

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting.

### Key Standards

- **TypeScript**: All code must be properly typed. Avoid using `any`.
- **Formatting**: Run `pnpm format` before committing
- **Linting**: Run `pnpm lint:fix` to auto-fix issues
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx`)
  - Hooks: camelCase with `use` prefix (e.g., `useMyHook.ts`)
  - Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `myUtil.ts`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`)

### File Structure

```
src/
├── components/     # React components
├── contexts/       # React contexts
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
├── pages/          # Next.js pages and API routes
├── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
├── utils/          # Utility functions
└── test/           # Test setup files
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe("ComponentName", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  it("should do something specific", () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = "test";

    // Act
    const result = myFunction(input);

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe("expected");
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Run tests with UI
pnpm test:ui
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```
