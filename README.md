# 🌟 Alexa Share — Home Assistant Add-on

### Select exactly which entities you want to share with Amazon Alexa

**Alexa Share** is a Home Assistant add-on designed to give you fine‑grained control over what your Amazon Alexa integration can see. Instead of exposing your entire smart home to Alexa, this add-on lets you choose _exactly_ which entities should be shared — nothing more, nothing less.

This means better privacy, cleaner Alexa device lists, and a smarter, more intentional voice assistant experience.

## ✨ Why Alexa Share?

Home Assistant’s built‑in [Amazon Alexa integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/alexa/) is powerful, but it can sometimes expose more entities than you’d like. If you’ve ever opened the Alexa app and found dozens of devices you never intended to share, you know the feeling.

**Alexa Share solves that.**

With this add-on, you can:

- 🟦 **Select specific entities** to expose to Alexa
- 🔒 **Keep sensitive or internal entities private**
- 🧹 **Avoid clutter in the Alexa app**
- 🎛️ **Fine‑tune your smart home voice experience**
- ⚡ **Make Alexa faster and more reliable** by reducing unnecessary devices

## 🧠 How It Works

Alexa Share provides a simple web interface (powered by a Next.js app) where you can:

1. Browse all your Home Assistant entities
2. Choose which ones should be shared with Alexa
3. Save your selection
4. Let the add-on automatically generate the correct configuration for the Alexa integration

No YAML editing. No digging through configuration files. No accidental oversharing.

Just a clean, intuitive UI that puts you in control.

## ❤️ Why You’ll Love It

Smart homes are personal. Not every sensor, switch, or automation needs to be visible to your voice assistant. Alexa Share gives you the power to curate your Alexa experience so it feels intentional, tidy, and private.

If you’ve ever wished for a simple way to manage Alexa’s visibility into your Home Assistant setup, this add-on is exactly what you’ve been waiting for.
